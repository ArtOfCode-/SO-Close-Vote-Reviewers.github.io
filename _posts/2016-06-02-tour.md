# TOUR

The Stack Overflow Close Vote Reviewers is just a chat room on Stak Overflow. So [**be nice**](http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice) also applies here!

## ALLOWED

 - You can post a [\*-pls] request, *but* please use the following format: "[\*-pls] **REASON** post link" (\*close/reopen/delete/undelete)
   - These requrests should NOT be a habit and only be used when needed
   - Please don't spam the room with requests

## NOT ALLOWED

 - Don't ask for upvotes nor for downvotes
 - Please avoid [one boxes](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq#formatting) so the room does not get unreadable by them


**If you have a question from any nature just ask in the chat or one of the room owners if they are around.**
