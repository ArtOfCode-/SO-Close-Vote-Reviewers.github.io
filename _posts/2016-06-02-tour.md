# TOUR

The Stack Overflow Close Vote Reviewers is just a chat room on Stack Overflow. So [**be nice**](http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice) also applies here!

## ALLOWED

 - You can post a [\*-pls] request, *but* please use the following format: "[\*-pls] **REASON** post link" (\*cv/reopen/del/undel)
   - These requests should NOT be a habit and should only be used when needed
   - Please don't spam the room with requests

## NOT ALLOWED

 - Don't ask for upvotes or downvotes
 - Please avoid posting [oneboxed](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq#formatting) messages; they take up valuable space

**If you have a question of any nature, just ask in the chat, or ask one of the room owners if they are around.**
